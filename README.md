### Task
Please implement your own class 'Factory' which will have the same behavior as 'Struct' class.

### Howto
To run test:
install gem 'rspec' and type in your terminal 'rspec factory_spec.rb'
For extra checking in the terminal do:
'ruby factory-task.rb' and you'll see something like "Hello Dave!"
[See slide *23 of RubyGarage (metaprogramming)*](http://rubygarage.github.io/public/metaprogramming/#struct) for more info

### [*Ruby Documentation for Struct*](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Struct.html#method-i-members)
A Struct is a way to create a very simple class object without the overhead of actually creating a new class.
The Struct is essentially a very simple class that allows you to encapsulate attributes and accessor methods without having to explicitly define a class.
