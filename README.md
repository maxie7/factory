### Task
Please implement your own class 'Factory' which will have the same behavior as 'Struct' class.

### All About
A Struct is a way to create a very simple class object without the overhead of actually creating a new class.
The Struct is essentially a very simple class that allows you to encapsulate attributes and accessor methods without having to explicitly define a class.
